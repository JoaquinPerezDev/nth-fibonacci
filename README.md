# nth-fibonacci

ALGO EXPERT EASY

The fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: The first number of the sequence is
0, the second is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th
numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer and returns the nth fibonacci
number.

Important note: The Fibonacci sequence is often definited with its first two
numbers as *F0 = 0* and *F1 = 1*. For the purpose of this question, the first
Fibonacci number is *F0*; therefore, *getNthFib(1) is equal to *F0*,
getNthFib(2) is equal to *F1*, etc.

Sample input:   n = 6; <br>
Sample output:  5 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
